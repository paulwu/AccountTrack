# Feature Specification: Sales Account Status Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-sales`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Sales Account Status web application that:\nDOMAIN OBJECTS:\n- Account (name, owner, industry, ARR, stage, last-touch)\n- AccountHistory entry (timestamp, actor, action, notes, linked opportunity)\n- AccountStatus (enum + service-level metadata)\n\nFEATURES:\n- Dashboard listing accounts with filters by status, owner, region\n- Account detail page showing profile, current status, full activity history\n- Inline status transitions with validation + comment capture\n- Global search across accounts and history entries\n- Audit trail download (CSV/PDF) per account\n- Role-based access (sales rep, manager, admin)\n\nINTEGRATIONS:\n- Azure AD for authentication (OAuth 2.1)\n- Azure Cosmos DB (Core SQL API) primary data store\n- Azure Identity / Key Vault for secrets\n- Azure Monitor for observability\n\nNONFUNCTIONAL:\n- Deployable via Azure App Service + Managed Identity\n- Frontend responsive SPA accessible on tablets/desktop\n- API rate limiting and soft-delete for records\n- Automated testing ‚â•90% coverage"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A sales representative signs in, views the account dashboard, filters to their assigned accounts, opens a specific account to review its profile and activity history, updates the account status with required notes, and exports the recent audit trail for a compliance review.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated sales rep, **when** they filter the dashboard by "In Negotiation" status, **then** only accounts currently in that status appear with correct counts.
2. **Given** a manager viewing an account detail page, **when** they approve a status transition requiring commentary, **then** the status updates, the comment is stored in history, and the change is reflected across the dashboard within the same session.
3. **Given** an admin user, **when** they perform a global search using account name or activity keywords, **then** matching accounts and history entries surface with clear differentiation and access to full detail pages.
4. **Given** any authorized role, **when** they request an audit trail export from an account detail page, **then** a downloadable CSV and PDF containing the requested timeframe is generated and logged for compliance.

### Edge Cases
- When users attempt to change status outside the linear pipeline order, the system MUST reject the action and indicate the next valid stage.
- What happens when multiple users attempt to update the same account simultaneously?
- How is access handled for users assigned to no accounts or when filters return zero results?
- What is the expected behavior if audit trail generation exceeds a preset size limit or times out?
- How are deleted or soft-deleted accounts surfaced (if at all) in search and history views?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST require users to authenticate via the designated identity provider before accessing any account data.
- **FR-002**: The dashboard MUST list all accessible accounts with filters for status, owner, and region, providing real-time counts for each filter combination.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to open an account detail page showing core metadata (name, owner, industry, ARR, stage, last-touch) and the complete chronological history of actions.
- **FR-004**: The application MUST support inline account status transitions that enforce validation rules, capture required comments, and record each change in the account history.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide global search across account profiles and history entries, returning relevant results with contextual snippets.
- **FR-006**: Authorized users MUST be able to download an audit trail for a selected account in CSV and PDF formats covering a chosen date range.
- **FR-007**: Role-based access control MUST limit capabilities so sales reps, managers, and admins only see and perform actions allowed for their role.
- **FR-008**: The platform MUST log all access and data modification events for monitoring and compliance reporting.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST support soft deletion of accounts and history entries so they are excluded from standard views while remaining retrievable for compliance.
- **FR-010**: The application MUST enforce rate limits on API interactions to protect backend resources.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST enforce a linear account status pipeline (Lead ‚Üí Qualified ‚Üí Proposal ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Closed Won/Lost) with no forward skipping or backward jumps; invalid requests MUST be rejected with descriptive validation errors.
- **FR-012**: Audit trail exports MUST allow user-selected date ranges up to 12 months and generate files ‚â§10 MB; larger requests MUST be queued for background processing with user notification.

*Ambiguities identified:* None.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Account**: Represents a customer or prospect organization with attributes such as name, owner, industry, ARR, current stage, and last-touch date. Associates with AccountHistory and current AccountStatus.
- **AccountHistory Entry**: Records timestamped actions taken on an account, including actor, action type, notes, linked opportunity, and resulting status. Supports filtering and audit exports.
- **AccountStatus**: Defines allowable status values with service-level metadata (e.g., required response times, escalation rules) and informs business logic for transitions.
- **User**: Represents authenticated personnel with roles (sales rep, manager, admin) that determine access rights to accounts and actions.
